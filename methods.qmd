<!-- Statistical Analysis -->
<div id="panel_m1" class="content-panel">

## Statistical Analysis

Our professional statistical analysis of your data provides clear and structured results.

### Our approach is strictly oriented to your individual problem ...

We provide descriptive statistics, inferential or exploratory analyses.

We help you with understanding and interpreting the results:

- clear, comprehensible presentation
- visualization of statistical results
- explanation of statistical parameters

### ... and we apply appropriate methods and tools:

- correct statistical methods
- P-values and effect sizes
- professional statistical tools and certified software packages
- individual or in-house software solutions
- mean, variance estimation, ANOVA, Mixed Model, regression, correlation, time series, principal component analysis, ...

</div>

<!-- Design of Experiments -->
<div id="panel_m2" class="content-panel">
## Design of Experiments

To get the possible significance from a trial or survey you need a precise question and an accurate design.

### Together with you, we discuss these questions ...

- What is the aim of your study?
- Which influences must be considered or observed?
- Which hypotheses are to be tested?
- Which precision and power requirements do you have?
- What are your capacities?

### ... and thereafter, we plan the necessary sample size and develop the experimental design:

- definition of data and type of survey
- creation of forms for data entry
- calculation of optimal sample size(s)
- choice and construction of appropriate experimental design

For these tasks we also recommend the use of CADEMO - a software by **BioMath**.

<!-- Literature, Scoping & Systematic Reviews -->
<div id="panel_m3" class="content-panel">
## Literature, Scoping & Systematic Reviews

With a steep rise in number of publications and patents, it is a challenge to maintain a complete, exhaustive summary of current evidence basis relevant to a research question.
### We develop and apply standard tools...

### Based on established international guidelines ...

published by i.e. Cochrane Collaboration, CEBC (Bangor University, UK), CRD (University of York, UK) or EFSA, we developed our own standard operation procedures to search electronic databases, the World Wide Web or other sources systematically.

Our goal is to provide you with the essence of all available information on the topic you are interested in.

We apply internationally recognized standards (e.g. PRISMA, AMSTAR, AGREE, GRADE) to report review results and critically appraise the quality of research.

### ... and adapted to your needs, we perform the review and keep you updated:

- Systematic Review protocols
- identification of relevant peer-reviewed literature via searching relevant electronic databases
- identification of gray literature via searching the World Wide Web or relevant websites
- reference lists importable into your reference manager
- data extraction and meta-analysis
- descriptive and narrative data summaries
- scientific review report

</div>

<!-- Data Management & Processing -->
<div id="panel_m4" class="content-panel">
## Data Management & Processing

Professional data management is the basis for the quality of each study's data and therefore for the quality of its results.

### With a comprehensive pool of methods and tools ...

We manage all volumes of data from the smallest up to ‘big data’. We are experienced with data migration and data merging, especially with data coming from diverse sources.

Of course, we treat your data with strict confidence and will use it only in providing services on your behalf and in accordance with legal requirements.

### ... we handle your data:

- definition of data structure
- data classification
- development of data surveys forms
- data completeness and plausibility check
- data maintenance in statistical or database systems

</div>

<!-- Database & Software Development -->
<div id="panel_m5" class="content-panel">
## Database & Software Development

BioMath develops individual software solutions for fields of applied statistics and experimental design.

### We develop your individual software solution ...

- data base (design to physical implementation)
- linking of databases and programs
- automatization of standard analyses
- programming of interfaces
- development of databases especially for further statistical processing
- individual mathematical algorithms

### ... or offer in-house standard software packages:

- **CADEMO** - interactive software for model choice and statistical experimental design.
- **TRIQ** - software for planning and analyzing sequential trials.
- **PIAFStat** - software to analyze agricultural trials.

- [**{BioMathR}**](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/BioMathR/) (R-package) - Utility functions used at BioMath
- [**{CitaviR}**](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/CitaviR/) (R-package) - A set of tools for dealing with Citavi data
